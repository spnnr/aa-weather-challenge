# Weather app challenge

This app was fully built by Anton Uralev for a code challenge.
It uses open-meteo.com API to access weather data and to display it in a small app, built according to mockup provided for the challenge. If you have any further questions about the app and how it was built, I will be happy to answer them.

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
